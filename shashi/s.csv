Book Appointment Today As parents, we want the best for our children, especially when it comes to their health. One aspect of their well-being that often gets overlooked is dental care.

However, neglecting dental care during childhood can have long-lasting consequences for your childs oral health.

Block Bone Graft: In this particular procedure, bone is harvested from the posterior part of the jaw, typically near the wisdom teeth. It is commonly employed when significant bone loss has occurred in the front of the jaw. Sinus Lift: When bone loss in the vicinity of the upper molars results in the descent of the sinuses, a bone graft is employed to not only restore stability to the upper jaw but also to reposition the sinuses to their original location. Socket Graft: Socket grafting is a procedure where a bone graft is performed simultaneously with tooth extraction to prevent subsequent bone loss. Gum recontouring Gum contouring is a dental procedure performed by specialists to reshape or restore gum tissue around the teeth, often chosen for cosmetic improvements but occasionally necessary for treating periodontal disease. This in-office treatment involves the use of local anesthesia to minimize discomfort during the procedure, with excess gum tissue removed or reshaped using lasers or scalpels. Sutures may be needed to secure the gum tissue, and post-surgery pain and tenderness can be managed with prescribed or over-the-counter medications and cold compresses"

https://barvedental.com/services/teeth-replacement/,"Say Goodbye to tooth gaps and Hello to a confident, beautiful smile.  Are you experiencing gaps, food accumulation, or cavities due to missing teeth? We understand the frustration and inconvenience that can come with tooth loss.Our expert dental team considers various factors such as your geographical location, personal preferences, and budget to recommend the ideal tooth replacement based on your unique clinical situation. Book Appointment Today Reasons Why Replacing Your Missing Teeth is Essential Are you missing a tooth or multiple teeth? If so, you may be experiencing difficulties with chewing and digestion. Additionally, failing to replace a tooth can have severe dental implications. Why is replacing a missing tooth important? When a tooth is lost, it can have severe dental implications. Our teeth are arranged neatly next to each other, similar to pearls on a string. Just like when a pearl comes off the string, the other pearls become unstable, the same happens within your jaw. The rest of the teeth start shifting from their original position, leading to potential complications and misalignment.In addition to the aesthetic concerns, missing teeth also make chewing difficult, which can affect the first step in digestion. This can have a negative impact on your overall health as it jeopardizes the absorption of nutrients by the body. Options for tooth replacement We offer several options for tooth replacement, each with varying degrees of cost and time frame. Our experienced team will help you choose the best option that suits your individual needs. Here are some of the options we provide: Dental Implants Dental implants are a popular and permanent solution for replacing missing teeth. They involve surgically placing a titanium implant into the jawbone, which serves as a stable foundation for a replacement tooth. A dental implant is a surgical fixture that replaces the root of a missing tooth and fuses with the jawbone through a process called osseointegration. Dental implants look, feel, and function just like natural teeth. Dental Bridges Dental bridges are prosthetic devices that bridge the gap created by one or more missing teeth. They are anchored to the adjacent teeth on either side of the gap, providing a stable and natural-looking replacement.They are made up of two or more crowns for the teeth on either side of the gap and a false tooth or teeth in between. The crowns, also known as abutment teeth, serve as anchors for the bridge, while the false tooth or teeth, called pontics, fill in the gap.Dental bridges help restore the appearance and function of the teeth, improving the ability to chew and speak properly. They also prevent the remaining teeth from shifting and provide support to the facial structure. Partial or Full Dentures Dentures are removable dental appliances that replace missing teeth. They can be made from various materials, including plastics and metal. The main purpose of dentures is to fill in the gaps in your smile by attaching one or more artificial teeth.They can be either full dentures, replacing all teeth in the upper or lower jaw, or partial dentures, which replace only a few missing teeth. Dentures are a cost-effective option for tooth replacement and can be customized to fit your unique smile Don't let missing teeth affect your quality of life. Choose from range of options for Replacing your Missing Teeth. Whether youre in need of dental implants, dental bridges, or partial/full dentures, our expert dental team is here to help.
